        I am a full-stack software engineer who loves to write and fix code to find
        a solution to any problem. I use my problem solving brain and hard work
        experience to make life easier and more fun with intelligent code.

        I love coding because there is an unscalable potential. There will never be  
        a time in my life when I can say "I have learned it all". Coding is the only 
        thing that I genuinely enjoy continuously learning, and the fact that I can 
        continue to truly learn in the world of software engineering for the rest of 
        my life brings me joy.
